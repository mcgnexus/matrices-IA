Matrix Input App
A simple web application for developers and startups to input matrices and process them using the Kimi K2 LLM. Built with a modern, user-friendly interface and deployed on Vercel, this tool is ideal for testing matrix-based algorithms or integrating with AI workflows.
Overview
This project allows users to:

Enter matrices manually or via CSV.
Send the data to the Kimi K2 LLM for processing.
View the LLM's response in real-time.

The app uses a corporate color scheme (#3498DB, #2ECC71, #333333, #FFFFFF) and fonts (Montserrat, Roboto) for a professional look, making it suitable for development teams or startups looking for efficient tools.
